        <p> Hey, I'm Sheryl! Welcome to my travel blog! </p>
            
        <p> I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing and Business Analytics 
            at the University of Michigan. When I'm not sliding my way through the snow-covered pavements to get to class, you can catch me taking the next flight out 
            of Michigan! </p>
            
        <p> Growing up in Malaysia, I had the opportunity to travel around Southeast Asia.
            My first memorable trip out of the country was when I was 5 years old and I was super excited to be visiting all the Disney princesses in Disneyland at Anaheim, LA!
            Ever since then, I fell in love with everything about travelling: exchanging cultures, exploring new eats and more. </p> 
            
        <p> I created this blog to share my travel photos, tips, thoughts, and stories with you!</p>
