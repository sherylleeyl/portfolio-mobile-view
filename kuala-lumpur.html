        <h2> 2. Kwai Chai Hong </h2>
            <p> Kwai Chai Hong (鬼仔巷) is the city's latest project in preserving the Chinese heritage stretching back to as far as the 1960s. It is a small alley behind Petaling Street filled with numerous of murals that depict the life that it once was decades ago.  </p>

            <p>Kwai Chai Hong is also referred to as the "Ghost Lane" (directly translated from Cantonese). Rumor has it that the name came about long ago when the screams and laughters of mischevious Chinese-migrant kids mimicked the ‘kwai chai’ sounds. </p>

        <h2> 3. Batu Caves </h2>
            <p> Batu Caves is home to one of the most significant Hindu shrines in the world: a joyful homage to Lord Murugan, who triumphed over the demons in Tamil Hindu lore. The massive staircase that leads to the caves is comprised of bright bands of color. It almost feels like you are ascending a rainbow into the chambers of the gods.</p>
            <p> The main attraction though is the Temple Cave. What you should know however, is that visitors must ascend 400 feet (123 meters) into the 400-million-year-old limestone caverns in order to get there.</p>
